Above us are the same stars the Shoshone and other Indigenous people have gazed upon for centuries, long before the arrival of explorers and settlers. The air is calm but cold. Mark Jenkins, who has forgotten his sleeping bag, places his legs into his 50-liter backpack, stuffing our extra clothes around his feet for insulation. He wears my black puffy and wraps his own around his legs. We both lie miserably on the ice, waiting for our 4 a.m. alarm.\\n          To most of us, sleeping before a big climb is a myth, only executed properly by the most experienced. From my snug sleeping bag, I hear Mark snore from time to time in between shivering. When the alarm sounds, my senses are somewhere between a deep state of hallucination and consciousness. I wake to the cold, dark air and remember where I am. Jitters of excitement stir me to action, but soon enough I make a conscious effort to set those emotions aside and focus on immediate tasks.\\n          THREE YEARS AGO, while training in a gym in Jackson Hole for an upcoming expedition to Kyrgyzstan, I often walked down the hallway to examine a photo of a climber atop Teewinot. Just behind him rose the Grand Teton's magnificent North Face. I began to notice a distinct buttress on the face: a lone, tall pillar of what looked like clean granite. My ardor for this proud feature led me to consult Leigh Ortenburger and Reynold \\\"Renny\\\" Jackson's guidebook,\\xA0A Climber's Guide to the Teton Range. Encyclopedic in breadth and depth, this guidebook contains all the known routes and their intriguing stories. To my delight, I discovered that my magnificent 2,000-foot buttress was unmentioned. I began to dream.\\n          The Grand Teton was purportedly first climbed by the Hayden Geological Survey during a cold July in 1872. The explorers presented an enigmatic route description up the mountain's west face, but the snow and features they told of don't seem to match up with the actual terrain, which has cast doubt on their ascent. They seemed to take more interest in the rock structure atop the Enclosure, a subpeak on the west spur of the Grand Teton. The summit of the Enclosure was used by Shoshone Native Americans as a place for spiritual purposes. Evidence of prior humans on the Enclosure suggests that the Grand Teton may have been climbed well before white people arrived.\\n          Two decades after the Hayden expedition, William Owen, a man obsessed with being the first at any endeavor, showed up in Wyoming. After eight years of failed attempts, he found the key to the summit in 1898 with Franklin Spalding. Owen claimed the first ascent of the mountain, via what is now known as the Owen-Spalding or OS route. This was the beginning of a century of controversy over who the mountain's first ascensionists really were.\\n          \\n          Mark and I kick our aluminum crampons into the steep neve of the Teton Glacier. The beams of our headlamps sweep right and then left. We're searching for a snow bridge across the plunging bergschrund. Our opportunity appears at the top of a funnel where a large chunk of snow has fallen from a hanging block directly above our heads. Mark crosses the bridge first, switches from crampons and approach shoes to rock shoes, and sets out. We simulclimb five pitches of fourth- and easy fifth-class along an exposed, west-trending ledge. We have to down climb in several places and make one precarious rappel with our rope wrapped around a shallow undulation in the rock. We're moving swiftly, but our approach has taken over an hour longer than we anticipated.\\n          At the base of the climb, I rack and head up the first pitch of the unknown. It's my first rodeo on a new route, but not Mark's. He has racked up\\xA0miles\\xA0of new terrain.\\n          Mark is a Laramie, Wyoming local. He first started climbing in high school when his PE teacher brought the class out to Vedauwoo, an outcropping of granite known for its stout grades, flared offwidths and blood-letting ability. Mark's first big expedition was a failed attempt on Denali. As a hungry alpinist and professional writer, he began applying for spots on international expeditions. His first Himalayan summit was 8027-meter Shishapangma, in Tibet. This successful ascent in 1984 led him to a life of climbing big new routes all over the world. He also managed to slip in the first crossing of Siberia by bicycle (7,500 miles), the first descent of the Niger River in West Africa, and\\xA0the first descent of Hang Son Doong, the largest cave in the world, located in central Vietnam. Suffice it to say that Mark has considerable experience being the first to do something. When I started climbing with him this past spring, I knew immediately he was the partner I needed to get up the 2,000-foot north buttress of the Grand Teton. His eyes lit up when I told him about my dream.\\n          \\n          Mark and I find the first two pitches of the North Buttress Direct to be stellar climbing, following 5.9 hand cracks that tapered down to 5.10 fingers. For a moment, I think we've hit the jackpot, a future classic composed of solid rock and beautiful climbing. Then I start leading the third pitch. A perfect fist crack transmogrifies into scary, dirty, hard-to-protect face climbing. (This pitch will turn out to be the crux of the route, 5.10+ R.) My bones are shivering with fear after finishing the pitch. Luckily, the next three pitches provide us with enjoyable, if sometimes loose, moderate climbing.\\n          On the top of Pitch 6, water is running down the rock to our left, fed by a melting snowfield. The closest established route ascends this snow gully. We fill our bottles and simulclimb the next three pitches of easy fifth-class. The buttress again rears up before us and we dispatch a steeping 5.7 corner, followed by an awkward 5.9 roof. Here we take a break in a notch of the buttress, eat a little, drink a lot and briefly allow ourselves to be satisfied by our speed and efficiency thus far.\\n          After no more than five minutes of rest, we begin the last third of the climb: the final tower of the northeast buttress before it connects to the East Ridge high the mountain. I climb up loose \\\"ghost flakes,\\\" 400-pound slabs of rock ready to rip off at any moment. It's only 5.7, but Mark is below me in the line of fire. I attempt to link this pitch with the next, climbing a right-facing corner, traveling over more ghost flakes. The remaining gear on my harness is dwindling. I have limited options on what to place in the rock, so I run it out before building an anchor right below a large roof. Mark takes the lead up through this short but frustrating 5.9 overhang. The lip of the roof forms a pronounced bottleneck but he can't fit into the gap with his pack on (ice axe, crampons, puffy, etc.), so he leaves it hanging and easily clears the problem. He hauls up both packs before I climb this awkward corner. Now past the last difficulties, we return to simulclimbing.\\n          \\n          \"\n  }, {\n    id: 5,\n    name: 'Green Beanie',\n    imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/ySf34Pc/mis2186-9041-sac-a-dos-bleu-neo-35.jpg',\n    title: 18\n  }, {\n    id: 6,\n    name: 'Palm Tree Cap',\n    imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/CB3pW2n/web-0119-talon-pro-30-s21-side-carbon-1-2.jpg',\n    title: 14\n  }, {\n    id: 7,\n    name: 'Red Beanie',\n    imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/8mfbVWz/web-0065-tempest-50-s21-side-violac-purple.jpg',\n    title: 18\n  }, {\n    id: 8,\n    name: 'Wolf Cap',\n    imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/c1JDFQG/web-0466-aether-65-s21-side-garlic-mustard-green.jpg',\n    title: 14\n  }, {\n    id: 9,\n    name: 'Blue Snapback',\n    imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/gmTSHwy/web-0393-ariel-55-s21-side-black.jpg',\n    title: 16\n  }]\n};\nexport default DATA;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/home/mehrshad/Documents/crwn/src/componentsforArticlesPage/ArticlesListData/ArticlesListData.js"],"names":["DATA","sections","id","name","imageUrl","title","summary","text"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAMA,IAAI,GAAC;AACPC,EAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,CACN;AAEEC,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CAFN;AAGEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,YAHR;AAIEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,qEAJZ;AAKEC,IAAAA,KAAK,EAAE,MALT;AAMEC,IAAAA,OAAO,owBANT;AAUEC,IAAAA,IAAI;AAVN,GADM,EAgCN;AACEL,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,aAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,mGAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,8CAJP;AAKEE,IAAAA,IAAI;AALN,GAhCM,EAgDN;AACEL,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,cAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,4FAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,0FAJP;AAKEE,IAAAA,IAAI;AALN,GAhDM,EA6DN;AACEL,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,WAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,2FAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,+EAJP;AAKEE,IAAAA,IAAI;AALN,GA7DM,EAmFN;AACEL,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,cAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,iEAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAJT,GAnFM,EAyFN;AACEH,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,eAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,wEAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAJT,GAzFM,EA+FN;AACEH,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,YAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,yEAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAJT,GA/FM,EAqGN;AACEH,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,UAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,+EAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAJT,GArGM,EA2GN;AACEH,IAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,IAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,eAFR;AAGEC,IAAAA,QAAQ,EAAE,+DAHZ;AAIEC,IAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAJT,GA3GM;AADH,CAAX;AAqHA,eAAeL,IAAf","sourcesContent":["const DATA={\n    sections: [\n        {\n  \n          id: 1,\n          name: 'Brown Brim',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/XxRsXkG/mis2098-9173-sac-a-dos-bleu-neo-40-ars.jpg',\n          title: \"test\",\n          summary:`Since modern recreational climbing began in the late 19th century, breakthroughs derived from new technology and tactics have pushed it in myriad directions.\n                  Today, as international competitors at the highest echelons of the sport look forward to climbing’s debut in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, thousands of new enthusiasts have been introduced to the sport thanks to the burgeoning indoor climbing gym industry.

Yet all of this is derived from that sense of exploration, which the AWP strives to reignite.\n                “There is this common perception in climbing that the big mountains are all tracked out,” Lieber said. “That is way far from the truth.”\n               `\n        },\n        {\n          id: 2,\n          name: 'Blue Beanie',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/p3Jknyz/mis2077-3721-sac-a-dos-45-litres-mixte-gris-peuterey-integrale-45-10.jpg',\n          title: `Scottish snow and ice an international hit`,\n          text:`A week-long gathering in Scotland of mountaineers from across the world has been hailed a massive success as climbers from 22 countries enjoy Scotland’s mountains.\n                Climbers from Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East, the Americas and South Korea came as guests of Mountaineering Scotland to pair up with UK climbers and sample the unique character of Scottish winter climbing.\n                Ice-axe wielding and crampon-shod, they climbed well-known classic ice routes and hard, modern test-pieces – and also notched up six entirely new routes, including one amongst the hardest ever done in Scotland.\n                Some of the 60-strong group even took part in a mountain rescue, when they witnessed an avalanche on Ben Nevis and abandoned their own climbs to give initial support and First Aid to the victim until the Mountain Rescue Team arrived for the evacuation.\n                After a week of climbing, sometimes in challenging weather, both guest and host climbers were unanimous in declaring the event a great success, with the guests, most of whom have experience of climbing in the Alps and greater ranges – enthusing about the whole challenge and experience of winter climbing in Scotland.\n                Stuart Younie, CEO of Mountaineering Scotland, said “Mountaineering Scotland has been delighted to host this event in our 50th year, and to be able to welcome climbers from 22 different countries and all over the UK to enjoy some of the best winter climbing conditions Scotland has seen in many years. It’s been a great opportunity to showcase Scotland on an international stage and many of our international guests have been so enthused about the experience they are already talking about when they are going to come back. Thanks to our partner organisations and to all the volunteers who helped deliver such a fantastic event.”\n                Streap Alba Geamhradh 2020 – the name means Climb Scotland Winter 2020 in Gaelic – was revived this year as part of the celebrations to mark Mountaineering Scotland’s 50th anniversary. It was supported by the Scottish Mountaineering Club, The Alpine Club, British Mountaineering Council and Salewa.\n                Organisers had been worried that climbing conditions would be poor, with a relatively warm December and January, but in the week or so before the international guests arrived colder conditions blew in and plastered the cliffs and gullies with snow and ice.\n                The visiting climbers were teamed up with UK climbers of similar ability and climbed in various mountain areas of Scotland, staying in climbing huts in the Cairngorms, Glen Coe and on Ben Nevis itself.\n          `\n        },\n        {\n          id: 3,\n          name: 'Brown Cowboy',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/ggxyKDP/mis2111-8744-sac-a-dos-60-litres-mixte-rouge-prolighter-60-20.jpg',\n          title: `Tom Livingstone and Luka Strazar announced as winners of the final Nick Estcourt Award`,\n          text:`The winners of the Nick Estcourt Award 2020 have been announced. The award was established to commemorate the climbing achievements of Nick Estcourt, and to encourage future generations of expedition mountaineers. After 40 years, this will be the final year that the grant will be awarded in its current format.\n          The winners of the 2020 Nick Estcourt Award are Tom Livingstone and Luka Strazar who, Covid-19 restrictions permitting, will attempt a new line on the spectacular north face of Jannu (7,710m) in Nepal this post-monsoon season. In line with the spirit of the award the climbers will accept the true challenge of their objective by climbing Alpine Style and not carrying bolts.\n          Their bold, intended climb captured the imagination of the Trustees such that they decided to end their administration of the award with a higher than usual grant of £2,500.\n          Tom and Luka made the first ascent from the north of Latok I (7,145m) with Aleš Česen in 2018 in a seven-day round-trip from basecamp. This trip was part-funded by a BMC expedition grant and received the highest grade award, the Piolet d'Or.\n          Nick Estcourt died on K2 in 1978 and since 1980 the Nick Estcourt Award has kept his name alive by awarding an annual grant to mountaineering expeditions tackling objectives of the kind that Nick loved.\n          The trustees are proud to have kept the award going for 40 years but have decided that this will be the final year in which the grant will be awarded in its current format. The remaining funds will now be made available to the Mount Everest Foundation who will continue to keep Nick’s name alive by attaching his name to a single expedition each year which fulfills the criteria of the Nick Estcourt Award.\n          `\n        },\n        {\n          id: 4,\n          name: 'Grey Brim',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/GP0M4y3/mis2113-0247-sac-a-dos-30-litres-mixte-noir-prolighter-30-10.jpg',\n          title: `Finding a new route on the Grand Teton: the North Buttress Direct (5.10+ R)`,\n          text:`\n          August 14, 2020: We are bivying on the Teton Glacier below the North Face of the Grand. Above us are the same stars the Shoshone and other Indigenous people have gazed upon for centuries, long before the arrival of explorers and settlers. The air is calm but cold. Mark Jenkins, who has forgotten his sleeping bag, places his legs into his 50-liter backpack, stuffing our extra clothes around his feet for insulation. He wears my black puffy and wraps his own around his legs. We both lie miserably on the ice, waiting for our 4 a.m. alarm.\n          To most of us, sleeping before a big climb is a myth, only executed properly by the most experienced. From my snug sleeping bag, I hear Mark snore from time to time in between shivering. When the alarm sounds, my senses are somewhere between a deep state of hallucination and consciousness. I wake to the cold, dark air and remember where I am. Jitters of excitement stir me to action, but soon enough I make a conscious effort to set those emotions aside and focus on immediate tasks.\n          THREE YEARS AGO, while training in a gym in Jackson Hole for an upcoming expedition to Kyrgyzstan, I often walked down the hallway to examine a photo of a climber atop Teewinot. Just behind him rose the Grand Teton's magnificent North Face. I began to notice a distinct buttress on the face: a lone, tall pillar of what looked like clean granite. My ardor for this proud feature led me to consult Leigh Ortenburger and Reynold \"Renny\" Jackson's guidebook, A Climber's Guide to the Teton Range. Encyclopedic in breadth and depth, this guidebook contains all the known routes and their intriguing stories. To my delight, I discovered that my magnificent 2,000-foot buttress was unmentioned. I began to dream.\n          The Grand Teton was purportedly first climbed by the Hayden Geological Survey during a cold July in 1872. The explorers presented an enigmatic route description up the mountain's west face, but the snow and features they told of don't seem to match up with the actual terrain, which has cast doubt on their ascent. They seemed to take more interest in the rock structure atop the Enclosure, a subpeak on the west spur of the Grand Teton. The summit of the Enclosure was used by Shoshone Native Americans as a place for spiritual purposes. Evidence of prior humans on the Enclosure suggests that the Grand Teton may have been climbed well before white people arrived.\n          Two decades after the Hayden expedition, William Owen, a man obsessed with being the first at any endeavor, showed up in Wyoming. After eight years of failed attempts, he found the key to the summit in 1898 with Franklin Spalding. Owen claimed the first ascent of the mountain, via what is now known as the Owen-Spalding or OS route. This was the beginning of a century of controversy over who the mountain's first ascensionists really were.\n          \n          Mark and I kick our aluminum crampons into the steep neve of the Teton Glacier. The beams of our headlamps sweep right and then left. We're searching for a snow bridge across the plunging bergschrund. Our opportunity appears at the top of a funnel where a large chunk of snow has fallen from a hanging block directly above our heads. Mark crosses the bridge first, switches from crampons and approach shoes to rock shoes, and sets out. We simulclimb five pitches of fourth- and easy fifth-class along an exposed, west-trending ledge. We have to down climb in several places and make one precarious rappel with our rope wrapped around a shallow undulation in the rock. We're moving swiftly, but our approach has taken over an hour longer than we anticipated.\n          At the base of the climb, I rack and head up the first pitch of the unknown. It's my first rodeo on a new route, but not Mark's. He has racked up miles of new terrain.\n          Mark is a Laramie, Wyoming local. He first started climbing in high school when his PE teacher brought the class out to Vedauwoo, an outcropping of granite known for its stout grades, flared offwidths and blood-letting ability. Mark's first big expedition was a failed attempt on Denali. As a hungry alpinist and professional writer, he began applying for spots on international expeditions. His first Himalayan summit was 8027-meter Shishapangma, in Tibet. This successful ascent in 1984 led him to a life of climbing big new routes all over the world. He also managed to slip in the first crossing of Siberia by bicycle (7,500 miles), the first descent of the Niger River in West Africa, and the first descent of Hang Son Doong, the largest cave in the world, located in central Vietnam. Suffice it to say that Mark has considerable experience being the first to do something. When I started climbing with him this past spring, I knew immediately he was the partner I needed to get up the 2,000-foot north buttress of the Grand Teton. His eyes lit up when I told him about my dream.\n          \n          Mark and I find the first two pitches of the North Buttress Direct to be stellar climbing, following 5.9 hand cracks that tapered down to 5.10 fingers. For a moment, I think we've hit the jackpot, a future classic composed of solid rock and beautiful climbing. Then I start leading the third pitch. A perfect fist crack transmogrifies into scary, dirty, hard-to-protect face climbing. (This pitch will turn out to be the crux of the route, 5.10+ R.) My bones are shivering with fear after finishing the pitch. Luckily, the next three pitches provide us with enjoyable, if sometimes loose, moderate climbing.\n          On the top of Pitch 6, water is running down the rock to our left, fed by a melting snowfield. The closest established route ascends this snow gully. We fill our bottles and simulclimb the next three pitches of easy fifth-class. The buttress again rears up before us and we dispatch a steeping 5.7 corner, followed by an awkward 5.9 roof. Here we take a break in a notch of the buttress, eat a little, drink a lot and briefly allow ourselves to be satisfied by our speed and efficiency thus far.\n          After no more than five minutes of rest, we begin the last third of the climb: the final tower of the northeast buttress before it connects to the East Ridge high the mountain. I climb up loose \"ghost flakes,\" 400-pound slabs of rock ready to rip off at any moment. It's only 5.7, but Mark is below me in the line of fire. I attempt to link this pitch with the next, climbing a right-facing corner, traveling over more ghost flakes. The remaining gear on my harness is dwindling. I have limited options on what to place in the rock, so I run it out before building an anchor right below a large roof. Mark takes the lead up through this short but frustrating 5.9 overhang. The lip of the roof forms a pronounced bottleneck but he can't fit into the gap with his pack on (ice axe, crampons, puffy, etc.), so he leaves it hanging and easily clears the problem. He hauls up both packs before I climb this awkward corner. Now past the last difficulties, we return to simulclimbing.\n          \n          `\n        },\n        {\n          id: 5,\n          name: 'Green Beanie',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/ySf34Pc/mis2186-9041-sac-a-dos-bleu-neo-35.jpg',\n          title: 18\n        },\n        {\n          id: 6,\n          name: 'Palm Tree Cap',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/CB3pW2n/web-0119-talon-pro-30-s21-side-carbon-1-2.jpg',\n          title: 14\n        },\n        {\n          id: 7,\n          name: 'Red Beanie',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/8mfbVWz/web-0065-tempest-50-s21-side-violac-purple.jpg',\n          title: 18\n        },\n        {\n          id: 8,\n          name: 'Wolf Cap',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/c1JDFQG/web-0466-aether-65-s21-side-garlic-mustard-green.jpg',\n          title: 14\n        },\n        {\n          id: 9,\n          name: 'Blue Snapback',\n          imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/gmTSHwy/web-0393-ariel-55-s21-side-black.jpg',\n          title: 16\n        }\n       \n      ]\n}\nexport default DATA;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
